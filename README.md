# matplotlib-stylin
A stylesheet for matplotlib: has big axis labels, and a blue color scheme

## About the files in this directory

There are three files, a stylesheet with a `.mplstyle` extension, a csv, and a jupyter notebook.

To use the style sheet you must fork or clone this repo and move the mplstyle sheet into your local computer's mpl styles folder.

You can play around with the styling however you want from there. The stylesheet as I've set it up will produce a graph that 
looks like this:
